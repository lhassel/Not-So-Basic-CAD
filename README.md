# Not so basic CAD
My Not So Basic CAD assignments
Sweeps and Lofts (candlestick and hammer head) was an assignment re-introducing CAD. I created a Candle stick and A hammer head using the directions from SolidWorks

The tutor assignments were created to give everyone some extra practice using CAD to make sure that they knew how to use SolidWorks before moving onto some of our bigger assignments
